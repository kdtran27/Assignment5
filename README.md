## Assignment5

For this assignment, a dataset containing data on plant surveys was analyzed. The data set was created to map and analyze demographic rates of many common plant species in the shortgrass steppe of North America under grazed and ungrazed conditions.

Four graphs were plotted examining either area covered by species over all quadrants or area covered by each growth form over all quadrants during each year, a function of the mean precipitation for the year or another variable, which in this case was elevation.

Each graph contains an analysis of why commands were called and a brief discussion on the results of the graph.
